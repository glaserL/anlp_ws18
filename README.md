## Contribution Guidelines

Once we start to write our own code, it would be good to commit changes onto local branches and merge these later with the master branch. This way, we can avoid conflicts in our commits.

To aid this process, we can refer to the contribution guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
