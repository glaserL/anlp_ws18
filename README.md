## Guidelines for Pull Requests

Once we start to write our own code, it would be good to commit changes onto local branches and submit pull requests to merge with the master branch. This way, we can avoid conflicts in our commits.

To aid this process, we can refer to the some guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
