A review of work done on the statistical analysis of ``change over time'' in literary style is then presented, followed by a look at a specific application area, the authorship of Biblical texts.",

abstract={We explore the use of song lyrics for automatic indexing of music. Using lyrics mined from the Web, we apply a standard text processing technique to characterize their semantic content. We then determine artist similarity in this space. We found lyrics can be used to discover natural genre clusters. Experiments on a publicly available set of 399 artists showed that determining artist similarity using lyrics is better than random, but inferior to a state-of-the-art acoustic similarity technique. However the approaches made different errors, suggesting they could be profitably combined},
