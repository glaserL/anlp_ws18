abstract={We explore the use of song lyrics for automatic indexing of music. Using lyrics mined from the Web, we apply a standard text processing technique to characterize their semantic content. We then determine artist similarity in this space. We found lyrics can be used to discover natural genre clusters. Experiments on a publicly available set of 399 artists showed that determining artist similarity using lyrics is better than random, but inferior to a state-of-the-art acoustic similarity technique. However the approaches made different errors, suggesting they could be profitably combined},

  abstract = {We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a 1.6 billion words data set. Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

  abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a ?xed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common ?xed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, ?powerful,? ?strong? and ?Paris? are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns ?xed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-ofwords models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classi?cation and sentiment analysis tasks.},

  title = {Predicting the {{Political Alignment}} of {{Twitter Users}}},
  url = {http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6113114/},
  abstract = {The widespread adoption of social media for political communication creates unprecedented opportunities to monitor the opinions of large numbers of politically active individuals in real time. However, without a way to distinguish between users of opposing political alignments, con?icting signals at the individual level may, in the aggregate, obscure partisan differences in opinion that are important to political strategy. In this article we describe several methods for predicting the political alignment of Twitter users based on the content and structure of their political communication in the run-up to the 2010 U.S. midterm elections. Using a data set of 1,000 manuallyannotated individuals, we ?nd that a support vector machine (SVM) trained on hashtag metadata outperforms an SVM trained on the full text of users? tweets, yielding predictions of political af?liations with 91\% accuracy. Applying latent semantic analysis to the content of users? tweets we identify hidden structure in the data strongly associated with political af?liation, but do not ?nd that topic detection improves prediction performance. All of these content-based methods are outperformed by a classi?er based on the segregated community structure of political information diffusion networks (95\% accuracy). We conclude with a practical application of this machinery to web-based political advertising, and outline several approaches to public opinion monitoring based on the techniques developed herein.},
