# Group Contract

## Group Members
* Atreya Shankar (AS)
* Jules Hanel (JH)
* Luis Glaser (LG)


## Workflow

Within the planning paper we will try to outline milestones as precisely as possible in order to keep a detailed schedule. We will meet **each Tuesday at 12 o'clock** after the ANLP class at Campus Golm. There we will discuss issues, new ideas and assign goals to each member. These should be finished until the next meeting in order to ensure constant improvement and avoid idle time.

Each group member commits to either the weekly meeting or at least status reporting remotely. Skipping meetings or not meeting the milestones is fine, we ain't machines. When planning our project, we will explicitly define goals as mandatory and important or as strech goals. The project will not depend on these strech goals. In case someone of us drops out, we will ignore those strech goals to keep the work load manageable for two. 

## Technology Choices

The main way of **communication** will be a `Telegram` group, text heavier discussions might be moved to `eMail`. 

We will use `git` as a **versioning system**. More specifically we will use `GitHub` to share our current working results. We will keep the repository private until finished.

For **collaborative writing** we will use `overleaf` and thus latex.

For **progression tracking** we will use a dedicated `markdown` file within the git repository. This will contain descriptions of larger milestones, small todos and also the assignment of task to group members. 

For **reference management** we will also use a dedicated git directory containing `.bib` files and/or `.pdf`s
