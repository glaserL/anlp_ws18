% Introduction

together with Atreya Shankar and Juliane Hanel we will work on music lyrics. The original motivation was our shared interest in music and we were interested whether we would be able to find patterns only in the lyrical data when excluding the acoustic part. Some of these initial questions where if there's a difference between rap and pop lyrics, how they differ in emotionality and how music lyrics in general have evolved over time. 
This planning paper serves the purpose of structuring those initial questions, in order to keep our research focused. This will happen in k% TODO: FIX
 steps. First what data we will use, because this already will restrict the possible questions we can pose. 

% State of the Art

% Method

% Data
When first experimenting with our approach, we went with the first available data set from %TODO cite kaggle shit
However, we came across initial flaws, since the dataset was very biased towards a certain year, we will not use this in the end. We currently have to aproaches we could take from here. The first one will be to crawl data by yourself by interfacing with the genius API.%TODO link foot note citation sth
However, this is still in progress and we can't yet decide if this dataset will have less of a bias. The second technique will be to search for further datasets and integrate them into one dataset. However this would have multiple disadvantages. First it's likely that we won't be able to completely get rid of the bias and second will introduce new challanges like merging the data and unifying their formats which won't provide anything interesting for us to learn. 

% Tooling
For data house keeping we'll use a sqlite database which will be shared over github and interfaced via python. 

In both cases we will scrutinize % WORT richtig?
our data for any irregularities or unforseen biases and .. mach ma hoit wos mit ean.


% Further Work

I will write database interface to abstract from SQL

% Learning goals
Our project will use quite a few techniques that were not discussed in class. However we hope that using those techniques will give us not the ability to apply the knowledge and methods we learned in class on another project. We also will be able to try out new methds which will help me / us when deciding of the further classes to take during the masters programm. Or if I should drop this shit entirely and go for computer science lel
